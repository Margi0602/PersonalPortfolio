                    <h2>PUSH NOTIFICATION</h2>
                    <p>
                    Push notifications are short, informative messages sent by mobile applications to a user's device, even when the app is not actively in use. They serve as a direct communication channel between the app and its users, providing real-time updates, reminders, or personalized information. This feature has become a fundamental aspect of mobile app development, enhancing user engagement and retention.</p>
